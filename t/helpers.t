# NOTE: These are just here to make sure we don't goof and accidentally
# not test a bunch of stuff.  A few simple tests should suffice.
# Test::Tester doesn't work with subtests so use Test::Builder::Tester.
# It's a bit cumbersome, but not too bad... Just run the test you want
# normally (put "test_thingy(@args)" at the top of this file and run
# perl -Ilib t/helpers.t), copy the output, and, if it looks like what you
# expected to run, paste it into a heredoc.  Then just put the test in a call
# to expect_output() like the others.  (You may need to fudge the sequence numbers
# of any top-level tests (contents of subtests should be fine).)
# You can also debug the output (or get updated output)
# by passing (no_capture => 1) to expect_output().
# As long as tests are run in a reliable order (sort keys) it should be fine.
# If you're so inclined, feel free to use the full Test::Builder::Tester API
# (or something else).  If that doesn't work we'll figure something else out.
